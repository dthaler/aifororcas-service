# AIForOrcas Service

This repository contains a Worker Service intended to run on Azure
that runs an AI inferencing model to detect orcas and other types
of events.

It is loosely based on the [AIForOrcas-livesystem](https://github.com/orcasound/aifororcas-livesystem)
repository which was designed to detect orcas using python scripts in docker containers.
